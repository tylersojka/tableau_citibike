## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to learn the basics of tableau, and help Kate explore the possibility of starting a bike share company, like Citi Bike, in Des Moines, Iowa. After taking a trip to New York City and loving the experience of exploring the city using the bike sharing platform, Citi Bike, Kate wants to know if it might be a good idea to bring the idea to Des Moines.
