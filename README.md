## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to learn the basics of tableau, and help Kate explore the possibility of starting a bike share company, like Citi Bike, in Des Moines, Iowa. After taking a trip to New York City and loving the experience of exploring the city using the bike sharing platform, Citi Bike, Kate wants to know if it might be a good idea to bring the idea to Des Moines.

Using data recorded by Citi Bike for one of the busiest months of 2019, we analyzed key aspects of the popularity of Citi Bike. We looked at key demographics of the users of Citi Bike as well as potential large expenditures and information about the rides, and locations.
